Hi Alice,

Thanks for reaching out regarding the issue with accessing your website 'site.recruitment.shq.nz'.

After investigating, it appears that the issue is related to the DNS configuration. The domain `site.recruitment.shq.nz` is currently pointing to the IP address `192.168.1.10`. Since this is a private IP address, it's not accessible from the internet, which is leading to the connection error.

In order to resolve this, we'll need to update the DNS records from your control panel. I have provided instructions on how to do this below:

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. Log in to your SiteHost control panel at [SiteHost Control Panel](https://cp.sitehost.co.nz/).
2. Navigate to the DNS management section.
3. Find the `A` record for `site.recruitment.shq.nz`.
4. Update the `A` record to point to the correct IP address `120.138.30.179`.

Once this is done please note that it can take up to 24-48 hours for the DNS records to propagate, so please allow some time for the changes to take effect.

In the mean time if you need any further assistance or if you have any other questions please feel free to reach out.

Kind regards,  
Isaiah
